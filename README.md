In order to run the app you need to provide [ApiLayer](https://apilayer.com/) access key.

Copy .env.dist to .env with:
```bash
cp .env.dist .env
```

and put you access key to `EXCHANGE_RATES_API_TOKEN` variable.

The app uses this [api](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/exchangerates_data-api#details-tab)
to convert currencies.
